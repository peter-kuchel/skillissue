# SKILLISSUE

An easy to use cli text-editor for the vscode soy-devs such as myself who don't know how to type properly on a keyboard, and can't exit from Vim.
So that we can continue to avoid learning these skills, and avoid downloading a vscode server when ssh'ing into our cloud instances. 

# How to use    

The editor is very basic, with some surface-level similarity to existing cli editors. Using the following keys, you can:

### Quit [ q ]
Exit the currently opened file (we did it!)

### Move [ w, a, s, d ]:
Move around the currently opened document with these keys

### Insert [ i ]:
Insert characters at the current position of the cursor, exit insertion with ESC 

### Save [ z ]:
Save the current changes made to the file

### Redo [ j ] & Undo [ k ]:

### Select [ h ]:

### Copy [ c ], Cut [ x ], & Paste [ p ]
